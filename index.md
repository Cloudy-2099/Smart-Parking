# Welcome to Smart Parking ðŸš—
This project is a prototype of a smart parking monitoring system designed to optimize parking management using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system automatically detects vehicle presence through ultrasonic sensors and RFID, processes the data using ESP32, and transmits it in real-time via the MQTT protocol to a web-based dashboard. Administrators can monitor parking slot availability and receive notifications instantly when slots are occupied or available.

Developed as part of an undergraduate thesis at Universitas Bina Insani, this system aims to improve parking efficiency, minimize manual errors, and provide a real-time monitoring experience. The project follows the V-Model development methodology and includes alpha and beta testing phases to ensure functionality and reliability.

Key Features:

Real-time parking slot detection using ultrasonic sensors

RFID-based vehicle identification and access control

Web dashboard for monitoring and management

Real-time data communication via MQTT

Modular design for scalability

Technologies Used:
